# Federated Wiki (experimental) - Force Plugin

*This federated wiki plugin is part of an experimental code refactoring, which is very much a work in progress. See [WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki](https://github.com/WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki) (ruby), or [WardCunningham/wiki](https://github.com/WardCunningham/wiki) (node), for the current stable versions.*

The Force plugin renders nodes and links from a Data item as a graph with dots and arcs automatically positioned by a force relaxation algorithm built into the d3.js visualization package.
